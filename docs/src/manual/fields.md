In `whirl`, field data, such as velocity, vorticity and pressure, are stored on
a staggered uniform grid. Such a grid is divided into *cells*, with *edges* (which,
on a two-dimensional grid, are the same as *faces*) and *nodes* (cell centers).
Nodes hold scalar-valued data. Edges, on the other hand, hold the components of
vector-valued data that are normal to the respective edges; one component lies
on the vertical edges, while the other is on the horizontal edges.

Furthermore, there are two different cell types: *primal* and *dual*. On
the physical grid, these cell types are offset with respect to each other by half
a cell spacing in each direction. In other words, the four corners of the primal
(resp. dual) cell are the nodes of four dual (resp. primary) cells.

Thus, on a two-dimensional staggered grid, there are four distinct vector spaces,
associated with where the data are held on the grid:
- dual nodes,
- dual edges,
- primal nodes, and
- primal edges.
In `whirl`, these are each distinct data types. Furthermore, the relationships between these types are
defined by an underlying grid shared by all. By convention, this grid is defined by
the number of dual cells `NX` and `NY` in each direction; we will often refer to it
as the *dual grid*. For example, `Nodes{Dual,NX,NY}` is the type for dual node data
on this grid; `Edges{Primal,NX,NY}` is the type for edge data on the primal cells
within this same `NX` by `NY` dual grid. Note that, even though this latter type is
parameterized by `NX` and `NY`, these values do *not* correspond to the number of primal
edges in each direction on this dual grid. These values always correspond to the
number of dual cells on the grid, for any data type. This makes it clear the
grid is shared by all data.

## Setting up field data

Let's see an example of creating a blank set of dual node data and filling it with
something:

```@repl create
w = Nodes(Dual,(5,4))
w .= reshape(1:20,5,4)
```

Other data types on the same grid can be set up in similar fashion. To ensure
that they have a size that is consistent with the dual node data `w`, we can use
this in place of the size:
```@repl create
q = Edges(Primal,w);
q.u[2,3] = 1;
q
```

## Field differencing operations

Field operations transform one data type to another. Some of these are differencing
operations, analogous to differential counterparts in continuum calculus: `curl`,
`divergence`, and `gradient`. For example, a `curl` operation can act upon dual nodal data
(like streamfunction) and return primal edge data (i.e. velocity); a `divergence`
operation acts on edge data (primal or dual) and returns nodal data of the same cell
type. Note that these operations are *mimetic*: they maintain some of the same properties as the
continuous counterparts. For example, the divergence of the curl of any dual nodal
data is exactly zero. The curl of the gradient of primal nodal data is also zero.

Let's take the curl of the dual nodal data we constructed:
```@repl create
curl(w)
```

We could also make this a little more cute by giving the curl operator a symbol
and then acting upon the data as though it were a matrix-vector operation:
```@repl create
C = Curl()
C*w
```
Note that `C` is not actually a matrix. Rather, it is simply another name for the
`curl` operator, and `*` is defined in this context to apply `curl` to whatever is
to the right of it. The other operators have similar constructs.

Suppose we wish to apply the `curl` operation over and over. The `curl()` function
allocates memory for the result whenever it is used; this would become expensive
if it is done often. So it makes sense to preallocate space for this result and
use the `curl!()` function, which simply fills in the elements:
```@repl create
q = Edges(Primal,w)
curl!(q,w)
```
Note that we used a convenience function for setting up primal edge data `q` of a
size that corresponds with `w`.

Let's check that divergence of the curl is indeed zero:
```@repl create
D = Divergence()
D*(C*w)
```

## The Laplacian and its inverse

`Whirl` also makes heavy use of the discrete Laplacian operator, $L$. This mimics the
continuous operator, $\nabla^2$, and acts upon data of any type. Let's apply
this to the original data:
```@repl create
laplacian(w)
```

As with the other operators, we can also construct a shorthand of the discrete
Laplacian operator,
```@repl create
L = plan_laplacian(size(w))
L*w
```

An important part of `whirl` is the *inverse* of this operator. That is, we need
the ability to solve the discrete Poisson system

$$Ls = w$$

for $s$, for given data $w$. We achieve this in `whirl` with the *lattice Green's
function*. To outfit the operator with its inverse, we simply set the optional
flag:
```@repl create
L = plan_laplacian(size(w),with_inverse=true)
```

Then, the Poisson system is solved with the backslash (`\`),
```@repl create
s = L\w
L*s
```

It should be observed that the cells on the perimeter have not recovered the original values
of `w`. These are the ghost cells, and the Laplacian operation does not apply
to these.

It is also important to note that, although it looks as though we've constructed a
matrix `L` and performed various matrix-vector operations with it, this is not
actually the case. In fact, the `\`
operation associated with `L` is significantly faster than a matrix inversion.
Internally, it carries out a fast convolution between the data in `w` and the
lattice Green's function, via fast Fourier transform. The lattice Green's function
(LGF) table is pre-computed and pre-transformed in the original construction of `L`.
(In fact, because this table is not dependent on the size of the grid, it is
actually computed once for all time and stored in a file; subsequent applications
of it just load it in and use the portion of it necessary for a certain grid.)

The lattice Green's function has the advantage that it is independent of the grid
size. Let's solve the Poisson system when $w$ is a unit field, i.e. a field
of zeros, except for a single $1$ entry at one node. The solution $s$ represents
the influence of this point on all nodes. To see that the LGF does
not depend on the grid size, let's use a grid that is long and skinny and plot
the solution on it
```@repl create
w = Nodes(Dual,(50,10));
w[20,5] = 1.0
L = plan_laplacian(w,with_inverse=true)
plot(L\w)
savefig("Linvw.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](Linvw.svg)

The influence is not affected by the narrow grid dimensions.

## The integrating factor

An operator related to the lattice Green's function is the *integrating factor*.
Suppose we have the system of ODEs

$$\ddt u = L u + f(u,t), \quad u(0) = u_0,$$

where $L$ is the discrete Laplacian (on an infinite uniform grid), and $u$ are
nodal data (and $f$ is a nodal-valued function acting on this nodal data). The
exact solution of this problem is

$$u(t) = E(t)u_0 + \int_0^t E(t-\tau) f(u(\tau),\tau)\,\mathrm{d}\tau,$$

where $E(t)$ is the integrating factor (or matrix exponential) for the system. The
easiest way to understand the role of $E(t)$ is to consider its behavior when $f$
is zero and $u_0$ contains a field of zeros except for a single $1$ entry at one
cell. Let's set up this initial data:
```@repl create
u0 = Nodes(Dual,(100,100));
u0[40,50] = 1.0
plot(u0)
savefig("w1.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](w1.svg)

Then, $E(t)u_0$ diffuses this initial unit perturbation in each direction. Here, we apply it
with $t = 5$:

```@repl create
E = plan_intfact(5,u0)
plot(E*u0)
savefig("Ew1.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](Ew1.svg)

Note that $E(0) = I$, where $I$ is the identity. Also, the integrating factor has the useful property that $E(t+\tau) = E(t)E(\tau)$. From these properties, it
follows that $E^{-1}(t) = E(-t)$. Let's suppose we wish to advance $u$ from time
$t = \tau-h$ to time $t = \tau$. Then we can define an auxiliary quantity,
$v(t;\tau) = E(\tau-t)u(t)$, and this new quantity satisfies the modified set
of ODEs

$$\ddt v = E(\tau-t) f\left[ E(t-\tau) v(t;\tau),t\right],\quad v(\tau-h;\tau) = E(h)u(\tau-h)$$    

The result of integrating this set of ODEs to $t = \tau$ is $v(\tau;\tau) = u(\tau)$. In
other words, the integrating factor allows us to solve a somewhat reduced set
of ODEs.


## Other field operations

Other field operations shift the data, by local averaging, from one data type to
another. These operations are all called `shift!`, and they require that the
target data be preallocated. For example, to shift dual node data to the dual edges,

```@repl create
w = Nodes(Dual,(5,4));
w .= reshape(1:20,5,4)
Ww = Edges(Dual,w);
shift!(Ww,w)
```
Note that the edges in the ghost cells are 0; these edges are not assigned any
values in the shift operation.

We can then shift this to primal edges:
```@repl create
q = Edges(Primal,w);
shift!(q,Ww)
```

We can also compute the Hadamard (i.e. element by element) product of any data
of the same type, e.g.,
```@repl create
qâˆ˜q
```

## The grid in physical space

Thus far, we have not had to consider the relationship between the grid's index space
and some physical space.
All of the operations thus far have acted on the entries in the discrete fields, based only on their
relative indices, and not on their physical coordinates. In this section, we will
discuss the relationship between the grid's index space and physical space, and then
in the next section we'll discuss how we can transfer data between these spaces.

Generically, we can write the relationship between the physical coordinates $x$ and $y$, and
the indices $i$ and $j$ of any grid point as

$$x(i) = (i - \Delta i - i_0)\Delta x, \quad y(j) = (j - \Delta j - j_0)\Delta x$$

The scaling between these spaces is controlled by $\Delta x$, which represents the
uniform size of each grid cell; note that grid cells are presumed to be square in `whirl`.
The indices $I_0 = (i_0,j_0)$ represent the location of the origin *in the index space for primal nodes*.
Why primal nodes? Since the underlying grid is composed of dual cells, then primal nodes
sit at the corners of the domain, so it is the most convenient for anchoring the grid to a specific
point. But, since some field data of the same index are shifted by half a cell in one or both
directions, then $\Delta i$ and $\Delta j$ are included for such purposes; these are either $0$ or $1/2$,
depending on the field type. For example, for a primal node, $\Delta i = 0$, so that $x(i_0) = 0$;
for a dual node, $\Delta i = 1/2$, so that $x(i_0) = -\Delta x/2$.

In particular, for our four different data types and their components

- Primal nodes: $\Delta i = 0$, $\Delta j = 0$
- Dual nodes: $\Delta i = 1/2$, $\Delta j = 1/2$
- Primal edges u: $\Delta i = 1/2$, $\Delta j = 0$
- Primal edges v: $\Delta i = 0$, $\Delta j = 1/2$
- Dual edges u: $\Delta i = 0$, $\Delta j = 1/2$
- Dual edges v: $\Delta i = 1/2$, $\Delta j = 0$

## Regularization and interpolation

Based on this relationship between the physical space and the index space, we
can now construct a means of transferring data between a point $(x,y)$ in the
physical space and the grid points in its immediate vicinity. We say that such a
point is *immersed* in the grid. The process of transferring from the point to the
 grid is called *regularization*, since we
are effectively smearing this data over some extended neighborhood; the
opposite operation, transferring grid field data to an arbitrary point, is
 *interpolation*. In `whirl`, both operations are carried out with the *discrete
 delta function* (DDF), which is a discrete analog of the Dirac delta function. The
 DDF generally has compact support, so that
 it only interacts with a small number of grid points in the vicinity of a
 given physical location. Since each of the different field types reside at
 slightly different locations, the range of indices invoked in this interaction
 will be different for each field type.

Regularization can actually take different forms. It can be a simple point-wise
interpolation, the discrete analog of simply multiplying by the Dirac delta function:

$$f_i \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i)$$

to immerse a value $f_i$ based at point $\mathbf{x}_i = (x_i,y_i)$.

Alternatively, regularization can be carried out over a curve $\mathbf{X}(s)$, the analog of

$$\int f(s) \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{X}(s))\mathrm{d}s$$

or it can be performed volumetrically, corresponding to

$$\int f(\mathbf{y}) \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y})\mathrm{d}\mathbf{y}$$

In this case, the function $f$ is distributed over some region of space. In each of
these cases, the discrete version is simply a sum over data at a finite number of
discrete points, and the type of regularization is specified by providing an
optional argument specifying the arclength, area or volume associated
with each discrete point. These arguments are used to weight the sum.

 Let's see the regularization and interpolation in action. We will set up a ring
 of 100 points on a circle of radius $1/4$ centered at $(1/2,1/2)$. This curve-
 type regularization will be weighted by the arclength, $ds$, associated with each
 of the 100 points.
 On these points, we will
 set vector-valued data in which the $x$ component is uniformly equal to 1.0,
 while the $y$ component is set equal to the vertical position relative to the
 circle center. We will regularize these vector data to a primal
 edge field on the grid in which these points are immersed.

```@setup regularize
using Whirl
using Plots
pyplot()
```

```@repl regularize
n = 100;
Î¸ = linspace(0,2Ï€,n+1);
x = 0.5 + 0.25*cos.(Î¸[1:n]);
y = 0.5 + 0.25*sin.(Î¸[1:n]);
ds = 2Ï€/n*0.25;
X = VectorData(x,y);
```

The variable `X` now holds the coordinates of the immersed points. Now we will set
up the vector-valued data on these points

```@repl regularize
f = VectorData(X);
fill!(f.u,1.0);
f.v .= X.v.-0.5;
```

Note that we have ensured that `f` has the correct dimensions by supplying the
coordinate data `X`. This first step also initializes the data to zeros.

Now, let's set up the grid. The physical domain will be of size $1.0 \times 1.0$,
and we will use $100$ dual grid cells in each direction. Allowing a single layer of ghost
cells surrounding the domain, we use $102$ cells, and set the cell size to 0.01.
Also, we will set the $(x,y)$ origin to coincide with the lower left corner of
the domain.

```@repl regularize
nx = 102; ny = 102;
q = Edges(Primal,(nx,ny));
Lx = 1.0;
dx = Lx/(nx-2)
```

Now we set up the regularization operator. To set it up, it needs to know
the coordinate data of the set of immersed points, the grid cell size, and the
weight to apply to each immersed point. Since this is a regularization of a curve,
this weight is the differential arc length `ds` associated with each point.
(This last argument is supplied as a scalar, since it is uniform.)

```@repl regularize
H = Regularize(X,dx,weights=ds)
```

We have omitted some optional arguments. For example, it chooses a default DDF
kernel (the Roma kernel); this can be changed with the `ddftype` argument. Also,
the lower left corner, where we've set the origin, is the location of the $(1,1)$
primal node; this is the default choice for `I0` (the tuple $I_0$ of coordinates in index
space discussed in the previous section).

Now we can apply the regularization operator. We supply the target field `q` as the
first argument and the source data `f` as the second argument.

```@repl regularize
H(q,f);
plot(q)
savefig("regq.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](regq.svg)

We could also regularize this to a field of dual edges.

```@repl regularize
p = Edges(Dual,(nx,ny));
H(p,f);
plot(p)
savefig("regp.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](regp.svg)

Scalar-valued data on the immersed points can only be regularized to nodal fields;
the syntax is similar, and the regularization operator does not need to be
reconstructed:

```@repl regularize
g = ScalarData(X);
fill!(g,1.0);
w = Nodes(Dual,(nx,ny));
H(w,g);
plot(w)
savefig("regw.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](regw.svg)

For a given regularization operator, $H$, there is a companion interpolation operator,
$E$. In `whirl`, this interpolation is also carried out
with the same constructed operator, but with the arguments reversed: the grid field
data are the source and the immersed points are the target. Note that interpolation
is always a volumetric operation, so the weights assigned during the construction
of the operator are not used in interpolation. Let's interpolate our regularized field back onto the immersed points.

```@repl regularize
f2 = VectorData(X);
H(f2,q);
plot(f2.u,lab="u")
plot!(f2.v,lab="v")
savefig("interpf.svg"); nothing # hide
```
![](interpf.svg)

Note that interpolation is *not* the inverse of regularization; we don't recover the original data
when we regularize and then interpolate. However, there is generally a way to scale the quantities on the immersed points and on the grid so that $H = E^T$. If we want to force these
operations to be transposes of each other, we can supply the `issymmetric` flag:

```@repl regularize
H = Regularize(X,dx,issymmetric=true)
```

This flag will override any supplied weights.

If we expect to carry out the regularization and interpolation a lot, then it
is often sensible to construct matrix versions of these operators. This
construction is sometimes a bit slow, but the resulting operators perform their
operations much faster than the matrix-free operators described above. To
generate these matrix operators, we have to supply the data types of the
source and target of the operation. For example, for regularization from
scalar field data to dual node data,
```@repl regularize
g = ScalarData(X);
w = Nodes(Dual,(nx,ny));
Hmat = RegularizationMatrix(H,g,w);
fill!(g,1.0);
w .= Hmat*g;
```
The interpolation matrix is separately constructed, and the source and target
are reversed:
```@repl regularize
Emat = InterpolationMatrix(H,w,g);
g .= Emat*w;
```
